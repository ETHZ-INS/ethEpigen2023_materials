# Week 9

## Assignment

Until next week, come up with a preliminary plan for your project, summarizing:

1. What is the topic?
2. What data will you be using?
3. What are the analyses you wish to reproduce, or the questions you wish to answer?

This is not a final plan, but the start of a discussion!

Write that up in a Rmarkdown that you render and upload to your repository.
